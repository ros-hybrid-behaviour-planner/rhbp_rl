    this class implements different strategies for exploring. 
    The random exploration chooses always a random action. Therefore, this strategy is not practical to use. 
    The e_greedy function makes use of a decreasing epsilon. Therefore, in the beginning is a higher probability 
    for choosing random actions. It is a good strategy, but inferior to the e_greedy strategy with pre train.
    The e_greedy_pre_train function let the programmer choose from where the epsilon starts, where it stops and how fast it drops.
    This is crucial as these parameter are highly dependent on the scenario. Also it included a pre_train phase. In this phase 
    only random actions are chosen. This is used for better training of the model as it does not restrict the model right away 
    in one direction to optimize to.
    Therefore, with DQN as the model, but also for most other models, the e_greedy method with a pre_train phase is the most suiting
    exploration strategy.
